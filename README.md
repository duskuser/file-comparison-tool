# file-comparison-tool
A tool for tracking changes between large sets of files.

How to use: 

Place compiled project in folder with a directory named "Files" and place all files inside of the folder.
Then simply run the application, and you will recieve a file named "Changelog.txt" which will contain a log of all differences found between text files.

Note:

This program is only made for comparing files that are text like in nature. 
It's intended use case was originally for CAD .dat files, otherwise, use at your own risk.
The process should be relatively instantenous unless comparing more than 30,000 files at a time.
